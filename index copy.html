    <div class="consent"><h4><u>Investigating a Contrast of Maps vs. Bar charts for Comparing the Plastic Pollution of Different Countries.</u> <br>
      You are being invited to take part in an experiment to determine the effectiveness of maps against bar graphs when comparing the plastic pollution of several countries. Before you decide whether to take part in the experiment, it is incredibly important to understand what the experiment will consist of, what is required of you and the purpose of the experiment. Please take your time to carefully read the following information. <br>
      <u>What is the purpose of the experiment?</u> <br>
       The purpose of this study is to identify whether colour encoded maps or bar charts are a more effective visualisation to present data on plastic pollution for a range of countries. 
      <br><br> <u>Do I have to take part? </u>
      <br>No, you have complete freedom over the choice. If you do not wish to take part in the experiment, please complete the Consent Form to show your rights in relation to the research. If you do decide to take part, you are still able to withdraw at any time without a reason. Please inform one of the lead researchers if you seek to withdraw from the experiment at any point. 
     <br><br> <u>What will the experiment consist of? </u>
      <br>You will be shown a series or 20 screens. Each screen will contain one visualisation, either a colour encoded world map or a bar chart, displaying data regarding the plastic pollution of 10 countries. On the screen along with the visualisation, you will have to answer one multiple choice question. You will be able to select and once decided you will have to confirm your choice. If you make a mistake, you can alter your selection before confirming. We will keep a record of your answers and the time taken to produce the answer and use this information to perform our analysis when the experiment is finished. There is no prerequisite for knowledge in data visualisation because this experiment is to find out which visualisation is best to notice data on plastic pollution instinctively. Knowledge of the world map is required for the experiment and appropriate training will be provided. The experiment should approximately take between 20-30 minutes. 
      <br><br><u>What data will we collect? </u>
      <br> The time spent on each screen and the answer provided will also be recorded and used for our analysis. 
     <br> <br> <u>What are the benefits of the experiment? </u>
      <br> There is no financial reward for taking part in the experiment. 
     <br> <br> <u>Background </u>
      <br>This experiment is part of COMP3736 Information Visualisation - Coursework 2. The experiment leaders are Edward Day (sc19ed), Mohammed Hamzah-Hafajee (sc19mhh), Efthymios Kyriakou (sc19ek) and Loukas Papachristoforou (sc19lp). For more information on the experiment please contact a member of the team by email:
